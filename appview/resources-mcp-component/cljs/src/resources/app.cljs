(ns resources.app
  "app-resources appview — reagent + re-frame, view built from jp-go-dds
  (デジタル庁デザインシステム) hiccup.

  Faithful port of the previous SvelteKit scaffold's status page
  (`svelte/src/routes/+page.svelte`, 84 lines): a static display of this
  Worker's own declared surface — title / project / kind, route count +
  list, wrangler var keys, an XRPC-enabled flag, and its own source path.
  Every field below mirrors the constant `app` object `+page.svelte` held
  in its <script> block, with two exceptions documented below.

  Three fields are updated, not simplified, to stay honest about what
  this migration itself changed:

  - `:app/route-count` and `:app/routes` now report what `wrangler.jsonc`
    actually declares (2 route patterns: `r3s0urc3.etzhayyim.com/*` and
    `resources.etzhayyim.com/*`), not the stale `0` / `[]` the Svelte
    constant carried.
  - `:app/relative-path` now names this file, not the deleted Svelte one.
  - `:app/xrpc?` is now false. This migration's wrangler.jsonc drops
    `main` (see that file's header comment and the repo README): neither
    Worker source in this repo calls `env.ASSETS.fetch`, so the XRPC
    route this page used to advertise as enabled no longer deploys. The
    XRPC handler itself is preserved byte-for-byte at
    `src/xrpc-dispatcher.ts` (moved, not deleted, from
    `svelte/src/routes/xrpc/[...path]/+server.ts`) — backend Worker/XRPC
    code is out of scope for a frontend migration.

  `public/index.html`'s inlined <style> was produced once, at authoring
  time, by `jp-go-dds.page/->page` running on the JVM (via this deps.edn's
  jp-go-dds git/sha), concatenating the vendored `dds.css` with
  `jp-go-dds.core/ext-css` — exactly what `jp-go-dds.page/page` composes
  for its own <style> block. This namespace only requires
  `jp-go-dds.core` — the browser bundle does not need `jp-go-dds.page` or
  `html.core` at runtime; those are JVM-only tools used to author the
  static shell once. Regenerate that shell (e.g. if jp-go-dds's core
  components or ext-rules change) with:

    (require '[jp-go-dds.page :as page] '[clojure.java.io :as io])
    (spit \"public/index.html\"
          (page/->page {:title \"etzhayyim-project-resources\"
                         :lang \"ja\"
                         :description \"resources — Resource Management Platform appview (reagent + re-frame + jp-go-dds).\"
                         :css (slurp (io/resource \"jp_go_dds/dds.css\"))}
                        [:div {:id \"app\"} \"etzhayyim-project-resources loading…\"]
                        [:script {:src \"js/app.js\"}]))"
  (:require [reagent.dom :as rdom]
            [re-frame.core :as rf]
            [jp-go-dds.core :as dds]))
